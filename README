----- README Project 2 Device Driver -----

The device driver has been developed and tested on:

Linux version 4.10.2-1-ARCH (builduser@andyrtr) (gcc version 6.3.1 20170306 (GCC) ) #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Mar 13 17:13:41 CET 2017


----- HOW TO COMPILE THE DEVICE DRIVER ----- 

Compile the sources.
$ make

Insmod the device driver. Old driver will me removed. Creates a new device using the dynamic major device number.
$ make device

Remove all generated files.
$ make clean


----- HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE DEVICE DRIVER ----- 

NAME
ioctl

USAGE
$ ./ioctl -p <pid> [request size]
$ ./ioctl -u <uid user> [request size]
$ ./ioctl -o <uid owner> [request size]
$ ./ioctl -n <filename> [request size]
$ ./ioctl more <request size>

DESCRIPTION
The program ioctl can be used to pass open file search querys to the ofs device. The following querys are possible. 

-p: find all a process's open() files

-u: find all the files a user has open

-o: find all open() files that are owned by a user

-n: find all files with a given name

The program writes the search results to standard out. The default request size ist 5 ofs results. You can specify the request size by the optional parameter [request size]. If you want to see more results from the last query, you can use

more [request size]
